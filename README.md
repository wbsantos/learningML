Exercises and materials for learning machine learning..

## Introduction
Exercises of a the first discipline on the PUC's Machine Learning course.

## Statistics
Scripts to solve some of the exercises on the PUC's Machine Learning course.
Important to know that the scripts are not as complete as they could be. For some of them it's necessary taking the complement of the answer, so let's assume the function returns a value X, the actual answer may be `x`, `1 - x`, `0.5 - x` or `0.5 + x`, it will depend on what information the question is asking for.
Some basic static concepts are missing altogether.

Note: PUC is a Brazilian university.
